# Introduction
In this work, a simulation model is developed for a cryogenic tank, where a novel and adaptive spatial grid approach is used to capture the sharp and moving Vapor-Liquid Interface (VLI). This allows the spatiotemporal thermophysical phenomena (heat transfer, evaporation, and condensation) to be addressed and calculates the temporal profile for various state variables such as liquid level, temperature, pressure, and composition. This approach offers a computationally cheaper method by leveraging on Differential Algebraic Equations (DAEs) compared to traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations.
